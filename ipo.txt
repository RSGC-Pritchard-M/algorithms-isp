Input
- A mouse click

Prossess
- The program takes random X start positions of 3 circles. One of them is red and that is the one you are trying to keep track of. Once the program hits 120 frames they start moving back and forth along the x axis until it hits 1000 frames. At this point the circles stop moving and you click on the one that you think was originally red. If you get this correct a check mark appears and if you get it wrong an X comes up. After 1500 frames the game resets and it starts all over again.

Output

It outputs either a X or a checkmark based on if you clicked the correct circle
