Input
- A list of binary numbers

Prossess
- Compares the bit of one number to the bit of another and if it is bigger they switch places. Here is the basic idea using numbers. My program will work the same way but compares bits instead of the whole number

18	 23	  23	   23       23	     23	      23       65
  Compare		     Compare		        Compare
23	 18       18	   18	    18	     65	      65       23
  	   Compare		      Compare				Sorted numbers
11	 11	  11	   65	    65	     18	      18       18
 		    Compare		       Compare
65	 65	  65	   11	    11       11       11       11

Output
A sorted set of numbers
